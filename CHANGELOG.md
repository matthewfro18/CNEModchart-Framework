## 8/10/21 (2)
- Hold scale fix

## 12/1'/24
- Hold graphic subdivition system (from Schmovin')
	- A subdivision system was already in, but hold notes were literally splited, causing you to gain or lose more heatlh (plus it caused more lag, as well as causing visual issues with texture)
- Code improvements
- Because of the new subdivision system in hold notes, now to implement this library in cne it is no longer necessary to change anything within the source code.
- Optimization.
